# REST-API_MySQL

REST-API for Philips HUE-like hardware with a MySQL database storage.
This is a small project that will make use of Node.js and MySQL to create a RESTful interface for whomever it may like. This project is in development and will continue slowly as the main functionality gets implemented.

## Possible upcoming features
* Basic CRUD access to lights (And others) based on Philips HUE;
* Basic authentication for update and delete;
	* Either via basic header authentication or url
* HTTPS;
* XML and JSON output  if desired.

## How to run
*Coming soon-ish*
